# Dactyl Manuform Forks

This is a list of interesting forks of the [Dactyl Manuform](https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard) keyboard.
This list was compiled by looking at all forks of the [Dactyl](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard) 
repository on GitHub.  I've included notes about what has changed in the forks, based on reading notes the author
left in the Readme, or by glancing through the commit history.

This list is intended to help you:
 * find out if someone else has already made the modifications you are planning
 * figure out which repository you should fork before making your changes
 * find interesting variants that you might want to build
 
It won't contain any forks where the author only made minor changes, such as changing 
the tenting angles or changing the size of the Arduino Pro Mini holder.

I will likely extend this list to include forks of the original Dactyl keyboard, and 
any other 3D-printable ergonomic ortholinear split keyboards I come across.
